  <p>There are other websites for cats in hats, however, these cats are imaginary.  An example of this can be found <a href="http://www.seussville.com/catinthehat/">here.</a>  As you can see, the website itself is very well put together, but the subject of the site is nothing more than a cartoon.  MY cat is real, nothing fake about it, no way!</p>
